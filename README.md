## Checkers-AI

A VERY slow re-write of a CS403 project found here: https://github.com/jasonwarta/CS405-checkers-ai

A Checkers AI (eventually), with catch2 testing and SFML graphics. Got lots of plans to expand with this, but I'm also very lazy, so lets see what happens. 

# How to run Project:
( Not yet tested on another machine. You'll need to figure out dependencies for now ) <- TODO
```
	1) apt install make cmake libsfml-dev
	2) "cmake ."
	3) "make"
	4) ./CheckersAI <cli options comming soon. For now, edit main.cpp>
	note: rmCMake.sh is there to help if you need it...
```
